# SuperAntennaz

The reduction in the cost of a rocket launch has enabled the development of a new type of satellite, the cubesats. These 10cm by 10cm by 10cm satellites weigh on average between 1 and 10kg.

The reduction in costs also implies placing them in low earth orbit, between 400 and 1000 km in altitude, which implies a very high angular velocity in the earth's reference frame. In other words, these satellites pass very quickly over our heads, unlike satellites in geostationary orbit, which at 36,000 km above the earth, are fixed in the sky, in our referential.

So to ensure communication with this new range of satellites, ground stations need to have the capacity to orient their antennas very quickly on 2 axes, the azimuth axis, from north to south, and the elevation axis, from the horizon to the zenith.

My name is Yohan Hadji, I am 16 years old, I live in Grenoble, France. SuperAntennaz is an antenna rotor that I have developed over the last year to meet this new demand.

It can support more than 10kg of antenna, orientate them really fast (close to 30 deg. /s) and in its final version, it is very simple to reproduce. It is therefore perfect to be built, modified, and improved by the community of space enthusiasts all over the world.
