# SuperAntennaz

### Introduction 

My name is Yohan Hadji, I am 16 years old, I live in Grenoble, France. SuperAntennaz is an antenna rotor that I have developed over the last year. 

It can support more than 10kg of antenna, orientate them really fast (close to 30 deg. /s) and in its final version, it is very simple to reproduce. It is therefore perfect to be built, modified, and improved by the community of space enthusiasts all over the world.
